## 🎬 **What You'll See**

### **Realistic Agent-to-Agent Negotiation:**

```
🤖 Buyer Agent:
"Hey! Before we talk price — any scratches on the screen or body?"

🤖 Seller Agent:
"There's a tiny hairline scratch on the screen—barely noticeable."

🤖 Buyer Agent:
"Could you do $565?"

🤖 Seller Agent:
"I can do $616."

🤖 Buyer Agent:
"Could you do $604? I can meet downtown."

🤖 Seller Agent:
"I can do $606."

🤖 Buyer Agent:
"Deal at $606! Let's set a time."

✅ DEAL REACHED: $606
📍 Union Station
🕐 6:00-8:00 PM
```
